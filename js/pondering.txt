Components of Cosmic:
- Environment
    Holds all of the objects and updates physics
    (also we need to think of a better word for objects since object is a "reserved"
     word and could get us in trouble)

- Camera
    Looks at the environment and draws what it sees to the canvas

- "Matter"
    Has physics and some displayed object, but knows nothing about how it is being displayed


Flow:

var ship = new cosmic.Matter;
cosmic.environment.add(ship);
cosmic.start();

// Starts loop
environment.advance(timestep);

// Which calls
ship.advance(timestamp)

var camera = new FabricCamera();        Are we making FabricCamera later? (yes)

cosmic.camera = camera;
camera.position(x, y);
camera.scale(1.5);

// Loop calls
camera.draw();

// which calls
ship.draw(offset, scale);
